      "text": "The Chemical Dissolver is a powered machine, and it, along with the Chemical Combiner are the most essential machines in Alchemistry. The Chemical Dissolver takes inputs and breaks them down into different chemical elements and compounds.$(br2)$(o)From Professor Warren's notes: I've been experimenting with the properties of magma, as a less volatile form of Lava.  While Lava will destroy most things, it turns out that I can use magma to more precisely break down materials into their components. Some components are more firmly bonded, and require an additional pass or two to be completely broken down."

      "text": "There are two types of Chemical Dissolver recipes which are denoted in each JEI recipe. First, there are recipes with $(thing)relative probability$() where all possible output groups add up to 100% and one output group will always be chosen for each $(thing)roll$(). Some recipes may have empty groups, however, resulting in a chance of no output."
