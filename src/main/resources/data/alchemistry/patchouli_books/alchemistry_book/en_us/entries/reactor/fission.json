See JEI for recipes.$(br2)$(o)From Professor Warren's notes: The rods dropped from the volatile blazes have inspired me to make a new machine.$()$(br2)The Fission Reactor is a 5x5x5 cubic structure, featuring a ceiling, floor and corner pillars of reactor casings. There are three fission core blocks in the center. The walls are filled in reactor casing or reactor glass. The chamber is entirely inert however without the fission chamber controller, energy input, and item input/output blocks."
